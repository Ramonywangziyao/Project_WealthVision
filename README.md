Computer Vision project for real-time activity recognition

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>To make Computer Vision and Machine Learning be more useful in life, human activity recognition based on real-time video stream captured by camera should be focused more. However, there are some technical difficulties for making the activity recognition real-time. There are delays or there might be big delays. This project aims to achieve this goal, to distinguish actions while reducing the delay with relatively high accuracy by adopting Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Networks(LCRNs).</p>
